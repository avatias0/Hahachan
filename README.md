# DO NOT ACTUALLY USE THIS
Security is written by a monkey, probably.

## HahaChan
Based off of a script I found called [HaChan](https://code.google.com/p/hachan/) which was still very much in the experimental stage (i.e. half of the features were completely broken).
The purpose of this fork is to continue development to the state that it is actually usable, and keep the core design philosophy of being easy to install without much configuration.

Changes from original source
 * Board name / descirption now displays correctly
 * Banner rotation now works
 * Replies now display in the correct order
 * Replies from partially hidden threads (too long on the index) are the most recent ones.
 * Basic image hovering script
 * Various minor HTML/layout changes
 * Melon is now the default stylesheet ;)

Pending issues
 * Untested and probably fucking awful security
 * Threads and replies have independent numbering systems
 * Issues when uploading capital case extensions (e.g. .JPG)
 * Deleting own posts doesn't seem to work (always invalid password) except for admin?

Future features
 * ???
