  <li>Welcome to HaChan<br />
  This is probably the buggiest peice of software I have ever used. The HTML is awful, half of the code was broken when I installed it. The replies were even shown in the wrong order (newest at the top). Threads and replies still keep independent post numbers (wtf??)<br />
  I fixed most of it, added a couple little features (like image hover) and  have done a little testing, but shits probably still buggy af - try not to break it please :)<br />
  On the plus side it is easy to back up and take to the next install.<br />
  Have fun - <b>badmyn.</b></li>
