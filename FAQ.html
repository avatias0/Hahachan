	<strong>Q. What is an ImageBoard
    </strong><br />
    A. An imageboard is a place where everybody can share images and comments, you dont need to register to post, and indeed, you cannot register, see more about privacy later. The fact that nobody has to register and full anonymity gives the user more freedom to express their real opinions.<br />
    <strong>Q. How to a &quot;register&quot;?</strong><br />
    A. Well, you cannot register, but there is one way to protect your identity! In the Name field, input your username, followed by a numeral # and then your &quot;password&quot;, for example fedekun#hachan, when you submit it, hachan will encode the word hachan with many different algorythms, to make it a 6 letters low-case string, no matter now long your password is it will always be 6 letters long and in lowercase, also with some numbers, this way you ensure nobody will be able to get the same &quot;encoded password&quot;.<br />
    <strong>Q. Do i have to upload an image?</strong><br />
    A. Only if you start a new post, as this is an imageboard, it is neccessary, but not when you are writing a reply, when you are replying you only have to fill the comments textarea.<br />
    <strong>Q. How do i quote?</strong><br />
    A. To quote a text just do this <span class="quote">&gt; my quote here &lt;</span> between the &gt; and &lt; symbols. To refer to a post do &gt;&gt;#post_number, and it will look like this <span class="quote"><a href="#">&gt;&gt;1235</a></span>  And finally to refer to a post in other board do &gt;&gt;/board/#post_number, and it will look like this <span class="quote"><a href="#">&gt;&gt;&gt;/a/1235</a></span><br />
